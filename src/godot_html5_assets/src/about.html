        <p>Understanding the challenges faced by vacant land owners in Pahrump, Nevada.</p>

            <h2>Historical Context: The Roots of the Problem</h2>
            <p class="py-3">
              Pahrump's development boom began in the 1960s and 1970s when companies like Preferred Equities Corporation subdivided vast tracts of land into small parcels, selling them to investors and dreamers seeking affordable desert living. At the time, there was little oversight on infrastructure, leading to the creation of thousands of lots without access to essential utilities like water and sewer systems. These "zombie lots"—as they're now called—were marketed as future residential opportunities, but evolving zoning laws and water regulations have since rendered many unusable. This historical subdivision without planning has left a legacy of over 10,000 vacant parcels in Nye County, many zoned Village Residential (VR), trapping owners in a cycle of unfulfilled potential.
            </p>
            <h2>The Zoning Dilemma</h2>
            <p class="py-3">
              Pahrump, Nevada, has experienced significant growth over the years, leading to the implementation of zoning laws designed to manage development. One such zoning classification is Village Residential (VR), which requires properties to be connected to city utilities like water and sewer systems. However, many areas in Pahrump lack these utilities, making it impossible for property owners to build homes or establish residency on their land. This restriction stems from efforts to control urban sprawl and protect limited resources, but it disproportionately affects rural and outlying lots where extending city infrastructure is prohibitively expensive or logistically unfeasible.
            </p>
            <h2>Water Rights in Nevada: A Complex and Scarce Resource</h2>
            <p class="py-3">
              Nevada’s water rights are governed by a complex system based on historical use and prior appropriation, often summarized as "first in time, first in right." In Pahrump, located in Basin #162, water scarcity exacerbates the situation dramatically. The basin's perennial yield—the sustainable annual groundwater recharge—is estimated at about 12,000 acre-feet, yet existing water rights total over 59,000 acre-feet, making it severely over-appropriated. State Engineer Order #1293, issued in 2017 and later amended, banned new domestic wells unless owners relinquish 2 acre-feet of existing water rights (valued at thousands of dollars per acre-foot). This order was enacted to curb declining groundwater levels, which have dropped significantly due to over-pumping for agriculture and development. Even with relinquishment, there's no guarantee a well will yield usable water, and alternatives like bulk potable water delivery are often prohibited by county codes, leaving owners with few viable options.
            </p>
            <h2>Current Challenges: Impacts on Property Owners</h2>
            <p class="py-3">
              Today, thousands of property owners in Pahrump face insurmountable hurdles due to these intertwined zoning and water issues. Without city utilities or the ability to drill affordable wells, owners cannot obtain building permits for residential structures, turning investments into financial burdens. Many pay ongoing property taxes on land they can't develop, sell, or even protect from squatters and vandalism. Resale values plummet because buyers are deterred by the same restrictions, creating a market flooded with "zombie lots." Homeowners and aspiring builders report frustration, lost savings, and dashed dreams of off-grid or rural living. The over-appropriation has led to misinformation, fear of future shortages, and even lawsuits against state rulings, highlighting how these policies favor established users (like farms) and deep pocketed builders of large new home tracts over individual landowners.
            </p>
            <h2>Future Implications and Our Vision for Change</h2>
            <p class="py-3">
              If unaddressed, Pahrump's issues could worsen with population growth and climate change, potentially leading to stricter bans, mandatory curtailments for domestic wells, and further devaluation of vacant land. Groundwater levels continue to decline, risking subsidence and ecological damage to areas like the nearby Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge. Our vision is a balanced future where zoning laws allow flexible, sustainable development—such as permitting off-grid systems, rainwater harvesting, or inter-basin transfers—while protecting the aquifer. Through advocacy, we aim to influence policy changes, secure infrastructure investments, and pursue legal remedies to restore usability to these lots, ensuring Pahrump remains a viable community for all.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Fight for Change</h2>
            <p class="py-3">
              The Pahrump Vacant Land Owners group was formed to address this issue. We are exploring legal avenues, including a potential class action lawsuit, to challenge the zoning laws and advocate for more flexible regulations that allow property owners to develop their land responsibly, even in areas without city utilities.
