        <h2>Class Action Lawsuit</h2>
        <p>Vacant land owners of Pahrump, Nevada, are exploring a potential class action lawsuit against Nye County to challenge zoning laws and water policies that prevent us from living on our land. Below are nine strengthened legal arguments we are considering to hold the county accountable and demand change.</p>

            <h3>Summary of the Potential Lawsuit</h3>
            <p><strong>Reasons a Lawsuit May Be Filed:</strong> Many vacant land owners in Pahrump face insurmountable barriers to developing their properties due to Village Residential (VR) zoning laws that mandate connections to city utilities (water and sewer) which are unavailable in rural areas. Compounding this, Nye County's enforcement of State Engineer Order #1293A bans new domestic wells unless owners relinquish valuable water rights (2 acre-feet annually), with no guarantee of success or recourse if the well fails. These policies render land economically worthless, preventing residential use, causing financial hardship, depreciated property values, and lost investment opportunities. A lawsuit would seek to overturn these restrictions, secure compensation for de facto takings, and advocate for flexible regulations allowing responsible development, such as off-grid solutions or bulk water delivery.</p>
            <p><strong>What Nye County Would Be Accused Of:</strong> Nye County would be accused of enacting and enforcing unconstitutional and arbitrary policies that violate federal and state protections. Specifically, the county has deprived owners of all economically viable use of their land without compensation (regulatory takings), forced the forfeiture of property rights (water relinquishment), denied due process through unfair and unpredictable rules, engaged in inverse condemnation by indirectly seizing property value, discriminated against rural landowners under equal protection clauses, violated state zoning laws by ignoring sustainable alternatives and endangering water resources, mismanaged taxpayer funds by failing to provide infrastructure despite collecting taxes, and infringed on constitutional rights to possess and protect property. These actions not only harm individual owners but threaten Pahrump's long-term sustainability and fairness in land use.</p>

            <h3>Legal Arguments</h3>
            <div class="claim">
              <h4>1. Regulatory Taking (Fifth Amendment)</h4>
              <p>The county’s zoning laws and water restrictions are so restrictive that they rob our land of all practical use and economic value, effectively "taking" it without paying us—a clear violation of the U.S. Constitution, leading to severe financial losses for owners who cannot build or sell at fair market value.</p>
              <p><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> The Fifth Amendment (via the Fourteenth) and Nevada Constitution (Article 1, Section 8) forbid takings without compensation. The U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City</em> (1978) set the standard: economic impact, interference with reasonable expectations, and government action. Nevada’s <em>McCarran International Airport v. Sisolak</em> (2006) and the recent <em>City of Las Vegas v. 180 Land Co., LLC</em> (2024) confirmed severe zoning can be a per se taking, where the Nevada Supreme Court upheld a $48 million award for zoning that prevented development, mirroring our situation.</p>
              <p><strong>Application:</strong> For properties like Parcel ID 032-161-08 (zoned VR-20), the county demands connection to nonexistent city water and bans new wells under Order #1293A, making building impossible, slashing property value by up to 90%, and depriving owners of expected residential use.</p>
              <p><strong>Example:</strong> It’s like buying a car but being told you can’t drive it because there are no roads—and the government won’t build any or let you pave your own, leaving you with a worthless asset gathering dust.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="claim">
              <h4>2. Relinquishment of Water Rights as a Taking (Fifth Amendment)</h4>
              <p>Forcing us to give up valuable water rights just to drill a well is theft of our property without compensation, breaching both federal and state constitutions, and exacerbating financial burdens in an already over-appropriated basin.</p>
              <p><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> Nevada Constitution (Article 1, Section 1) and statutes (NRS 533.005, 534.020) protect water rights as property. The Nevada Supreme Court (2022) upheld this. <em>Penn Central</em> (1978), <em>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council</em> (1992), and the remanded takings claim in <em>Wilson v. Pahrump Fair Water, LLC</em> (2021) support claims when property rights are stripped; recent bills like AB104/SB36 (2025) highlight ongoing relinquishment issues as potential takings.</p>
              <p><strong>Application:</strong> Order #1293A demands we surrender 2 acre-feet of water rights—worth thousands—to drill in Pahrump’s over-appropriated basin, even though wells are our only option without city water, leading to permanent loss without benefit.</p>
              <p><strong>Example:</strong> Imagine paying a ransom to unlock your own front door, only to find the key doesn’t work, and the ransom is gone forever—crippling your ability to use what you own.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="claim">
              <h4>3. No Guarantee of Successful Well and Lack of Recourse (Due Process, Fourteenth Amendment)</h4>
              <p>Making us give up water rights to drill, with no assurance the well will work and no refund if it fails, is an unfair, arbitrary, and unpredictable rule that violates our rights, leaving owners in limbo and amplifying economic distress.</p>
              <p><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> NRS 534.120 governs drilling but offers no remedy for failure. <em>Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.</em> (1926) demands zoning be reasonable. Nevada’s <em>City of Reno v. Citizens for Cold Springs</em> (2008) struck down illogical restrictions; <em>Wilson v. Pahrump Fair Water</em> (2021) noted no due process for new wells but remanded related claims, opening avenues for challenging arbitrary enforcement.</p>
              <p><strong>Application:</strong> In Pahrump, a failed well leaves us without water rights or water, stuck with useless land and no way to fight back, despite paying taxes and fees upfront.</p>
              <p><strong>Example:</strong> It’s like paying for a phone plan, only to get a dead line and no refund—except it’s our land on the line, with lifelong financial consequences.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="claim">
              <h4>4. Inverse Condemnation</h4>
              <p>By blocking all use of our land without formally seizing it, Nye County has taken our property in all but name, owing us compensation or a fix for the resulting devaluation and lost opportunities.</p>
              <p><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> <em>First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. County of Los Angeles</em> (1987) requires payment for regulatory takings. <em>Hsu v. County of Clark</em> (2007, Nevada) and <em>City of Las Vegas v. 180 Land Co.</em> (2024) back this locally, where inverse condemnation was upheld for zoning deprivations.</p>
              <p><strong>Application:</strong> Zoning that demands unavailable utilities while banning wells turns our land into a worthless asset, a sneaky taking by the county that has cost owners millions in aggregate losses.</p>
              <p><strong>Example:</strong> It’s as if the county locked our land in a vault and threw away the key, pretending they didn’t steal it, while we continue to pay maintenance costs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="claim">
              <h4>5. Equal Protection Violations (Fourteenth Amendment)</h4>
              <p>The county treats rural landowners like us worse than those with city water, with no good reason, violating our right to equal treatment and creating unfair disparities in property use.</p>
              <p><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> <em>Village of Willowbrook v. Olech</em> (2000) protects against unfair discrimination. <em>Yick Wo v. Hopkins</em> (1886) struck down location-based bias; recent zoning challenges like <em>Sheetz v. County of El Dorado</em> (2024) extend scrutiny to arbitrary fees and restrictions.</p>
              <p><strong>Application:</strong> Pahrump owners without utility access pay taxes like everyone else but can’t use our land, while urban owners build freely, leading to selective enforcement based on location.</p>
              <p><strong>Example:</strong> It’s like charging everyone the same for a buffet, but only letting some eat, while the rest starve despite paying full price.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="claim">
              <h4>6. Violation of Nevada State Law (NRS Chapter 278)</h4>
              <p>The county's insistence on tapping into the over-appropriated aquifer not only threatens the sustainability of our water resources but also ignores viable alternatives like bulk potable water delivery and storage, which are unjustly prohibited by other county codes. This approach directly harms the community's welfare by depleting a critical resource and denying landowners reasonable use of their property.</p>
              <p><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> NRS 278.0233 permits challenges to zoning that is arbitrary or capricious. In <em>City of Reno v. Citizens for Cold Springs</em> (2008), the Nevada Supreme Court invalidated zoning that failed to serve the public interest. Here, forcing reliance on a dwindling aquifer while banning sustainable alternatives like bulk water delivery violates the state's mandate for zoning to promote community welfare; recent bills like AB134 (2025) emphasize conservation plans as alternatives.</p>
              <p><strong>Application:</strong> By mandating connection to an overburdened aquifer and outlawing practical solutions like bulk water storage, Nye County is not only preventing us from using our land but also endangering Pahrump’s water future. This policy serves no rational public purpose and instead accelerates resource depletion, affecting all residents.</p>
              <p><strong>Example:</strong> It’s like forcing everyone to drink from a shrinking well while banning rainwater collection—senseless, harmful, and destined to run dry.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="claim">
              <h4>7. Neglect or Mismanagement of Tax Funds</h4>
              <p>We pay taxes for services, but Nye County pockets the money without providing water or sewer systems, making their rules even more unjust and compounding the inequity.</p>
              <p><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> <em>Board of County Commissioners v. Lurie</em> (1985, Nevada) links taxes to public benefits. This strengthens our fairness claims under equal protection; recent water rights retirement programs (AB104/SB36, 2025) highlight mismanagement in resource allocation.</p>
              <p><strong>Application:</strong> Our tax dollars fund county projects, yet we’re left with no infrastructure, amplifying the inequity of these restrictions and leading to unfulfilled public benefits.</p>
              <p><strong>Example:</strong> It’s like paying for a gym membership but finding the doors locked every day, while the gym uses your money for upgrades you never see.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="claim">
              <h4>8. Violation of Nevada Constitution (Article 1, Section 1)</h4>
              <p>By stopping us from living on our land, the county denies our fundamental right to protect our property, a right guaranteed by Nevada’s Constitution, exposing parcels to risks without remedy.</p>
              <p><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> Article 1, Section 1 ensures our right to possess and protect property. <em>McCarran v. Sisolak</em> (2006) and <em>Village of Euclid</em> (1926) support reasonable use; <em>City of Las Vegas v. 180 Land Co.</em> (2024) reinforces protections against deprivations.</p>
              <p><strong>Application:</strong> Without residency, our Pahrump parcels are exposed to neglect or vandalism, and we’re powerless to guard them, violating core property rights.</p>
              <p><strong>Example:</strong> It’s like owning a house you can’t lock or live in, leaving it open to anyone, while the government claims no responsibility.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="claim">
              <h4>9. Failure to Disclose Zoning Restrictions and Resource Limitations (NRS Chapter 113 Violation)</h4>
              <p>The county, sellers, and realtors failed to adequately disclose critical restrictions on zoning, utility availability, and water access, misleading buyers into purchasing land that is effectively unusable and violating Nevada's mandatory disclosure laws.</p>
              <p><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> NRS 113.070 requires sellers to disclose zoning classifications and master plan designations, including restrictions on land use. NRS 113.130 mandates disclosure of known defects affecting value or usability, with remedies under NRS 113.150 including rescission and treble damages. In <em>Nelson v. Heer</em> (2007, Nevada Supreme Court), the court clarified disclosure duties for known issues, supporting claims where sellers withhold material facts. A 2017 case study (Expert Institute) on a realtor's failure to disclose zoning changes led to liability for misrepresentation. Disputes under NRS 113, as noted in Switlyk Law (2024), often result in damages when disclosures are inadequate.</p>
              <p><strong>Application:</strong> In Pahrump, "zombie lots" zoned VR were sold without disclosing unavailable utilities or Order #1293A's well restrictions. Tax auctions and sales omit these, per Pahrump Valley Times reports (e.g., June 27, 2025), trapping owners.</p>
              <p><strong>Example:</strong> It’s like selling a house without mentioning it’s in a flood zone with no insurance—the buyer assumes habitability, but hidden restrictions make it worthless.</p>
